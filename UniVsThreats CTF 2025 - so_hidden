Learned a bit of Android Pentest a while ago before this CTF, I solved this challenge with the help of AI (Gemini). 

DESCRIPTION: We found an APK. It is useless, or isn't it?
An APK named "jokes_and_info.apk" was given.

First thing, I opened the APK using jadx-gui, which decompiles Android APKs and DEX files into readable Java source code.
After that, I copied AndroidManifest.xml and the code of MainActivity, and send it to Gemini to help me extract valuable information. 
Gemini suggested me to look at the function "Utils".

<pre>```
package com.example.uvt_ctf_2025;

/* loaded from: classes3.dex */
public class Utils {
    private native String getHiddenFlag();

    public native String getJoke();

    public native String getUVTCTF();

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("native-lib");
    }
}
```</pre>
Use `ls` to list files.
