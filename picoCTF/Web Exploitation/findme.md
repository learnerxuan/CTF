# FindMe - CTF Challenge Writeup

**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

## Challenge Description

> Help us test the form by submitting the username as `test` and password as `test!`

## Solution Approach

Given the hint about redirections and the challenge name "findme", I suspected the flag might be hidden in HTTP redirect responses that browsers automatically follow.

### Tools Required
- **Burp Suite** (or similar proxy tool)
- **Base64 decoder**
- **Browser with Developer Tools**

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Setup Burp Suite
1. Configure browser to proxy through Burp Suite (127.0.0.1:8080)
2. Enable **Intercept** mode in Burp's Proxy tab
3. Navigate to the challenge URL

### Step 2: Submit Login Credentials
Submit the form with the provided credentials:
- Username: `test`
- Password: `test!` (note the exclamation mark)

**Request intercepted:**

### Step 3: Follow the Redirect Chain

**First Redirect Response:**

Forward the request in Burp Suite to trigger the first redirect.

**Second Redirect Response:**

### Step 4: Extract and Decode Base64 Data

I noticed both redirect URLs contain base64-encoded data in the `id` parameter:

### Step 5: Reconstruct the Flag

Combining both decoded parts:
- Part 1: `picoCTF{proxies_al`
- Part 2: `l_the_way_d1c0b112}`

**Complete Flag:** `picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_d1c0b112}`

## Technical Analysis

### Why This Attack Works

1. **Automatic Redirect Following:** Modern browsers automatically follow HTTP redirects (301, 302, 307, 308), hiding intermediate responses from users
2. **Information Leakage:** Sensitive data can be embedded in redirect URLs, headers, or cookies during the redirect chain
3. **Base64 Obfuscation:** The flag was split and base64-encoded across multiple redirect steps to avoid easy detection

### Redirect Chain Visualization

```
[Login Form] 
     ↓ POST /login (credentials)
[302 Redirect] → /next-page/id=bF90aGVfd2F5X2QxYzBiMTEyfQ==
     ↓ GET (first redirect)
[302 Redirect] → /next-page/id=cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs  
     ↓ GET (second redirect)
[Final Page] → 200 OK
```

### Security Implications

This challenge demonstrates several real-world vulnerabilities:

1. **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data leaked in redirect URLs
2. **Session Management Issues:** Poor handling of authentication flows
3. **Client-Side Security Assumptions:** Relying on browsers to hide intermediate steps

## Flag

`picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_d1c0b112}`
